<main data-title="Search input">
	<p>
		A search bar accepts text from users, which can be used as input for a search. By default, a search element shows a placeholder of search and a magnifying glass icon.
	</p>
	<p>
		A small amount of JavaScript is used to normalise the input element's behaviour across all modern browsers, which means the only HTML required to use a search input is: <code>&lt;input type="search" /&gt;</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		The default search bar shows a cross that is used to clear the contents of the input.
	</p>
	<input type="search" />

	<p>
		A special button element can be applied to empty search elements by using the <code>data-button</code> attribute. 
	</p>

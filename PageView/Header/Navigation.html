	<p>
		In the top left of pages with hierarchy, a <code>&lt;nav></code> element can be placed containing a link to the previous page in the hierarchy.
	</p>
	<p>
		To allow multiple-nested hierarchies, a <code>data-back</code> attribute can be added to the <code>&lt;main></code> element on the page, which can be read by your server/client side framework to update the nav link, keeping presentation data within the HTML file it represents.

<main data-title="Footer menu">
	<p>
		The footer below is a contextual menu of action buttons.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right-aligned, the primary action button is displayed with 100% opacity to exagerate its importance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The buttons on this page are not set to do anything, but can be linked to trigger JavaScript events, submit forms, or interact with hidden areas on the page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other elements that can be used in place of <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements are <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>. Using a label, it is possible to link the footer with hidden radio/checkbox inputs to represent state of the current view.

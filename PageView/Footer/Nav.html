<main data-title="Footer nav">
	<p>
		For this example, three more pages have been created to navigate between using the footer at the bottom of the page. There's this page (displayed as home), <a href="Nav-Messages.html">Messages</a>, <a href="Nav-Settings.html">Settings</a>, and <a href="Nav-Donate.html">Donate.
	</p>
	<p>
		The pages don't do anything apart from show dummy content, allowing you to interact with the footer properly.
	</p>
	<p>
		This type of footer consists of a <code>&le;menu></code> element with multiple <code>&lt;li></code> elements, each with their own anchor.
	</p>
	<p>
		The currently-selected li can be given a class name of "selected" by your server/client side framework to highlight it as the currently-selected tab.
